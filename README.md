# action-recorder
Automating my admin tasks by recording actions. (Just Like Excel!)

Actions recorded:
- Mouse clicks (Left and right)

Actions that can be added:
- Copy (Control + C)
- Paste (Control + V)
- Repeat Script n times
- Wait milliseconds
- Drag loc to loc
- Enter keyboard text

Data Collected:
- The specific action
- Cursor position of where it happens

How is this useful in admin?

Well, I have multiple tasks that are just too repetitive and some of them can be automated, while others not. And they are often long (thousands of files requiring processing), therefore this program is game-changing if it works!

Who is this program intended for?

Just me


-> The beautifying process of this code will be left for later (never)
-> I've broken so many programming principles just because i want to get this program done quickly.
