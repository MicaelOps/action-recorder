# action-recorder
Automating my admin tasks by recording actions. (Just Like Excel!)

Actions recorded:
- Mouse clicks (Left and right)
- Copy (Control + C)
- Paste (Control + V)

Data Collected:
- The specific action
- Cursor position of where it happen

How is this useful in admin?

Well, I have multiple tasks that are just too repetitive and some of them can be automated others not. And they are often long (thousands of files), therefore this program is game-changing if it works!

Who is this program inteded for?

Just me
